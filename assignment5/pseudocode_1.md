1. Ask the user for the number of years
2. Convert the input to an integer and store it in the variable num_years
3. Initialize the variable total_rainfall to 0
4. Calculate the total number of months by multiplying num_years by 12 and store it in the variable num_months
5. Start an outer loop for each year from 1 to num_years + 1
    6. Start an inner loop for each month from 1 to 13
        7. Ask the user for the inches of rainfall for the current year and month
        8. Convert the input to a float and store it in the variable rainfall
        9. Add the rainfall to the total_rainfall
10. Calculate the average rainfall by dividing total_rainfall by num_months and store it in the variable average_rainfall
11. Display the number of months, total inches of rainfall, and average rainfall per month
